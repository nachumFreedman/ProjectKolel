                  <p>The <b>Dafyomi Advancement Forum</b>, under the auspices of <b>Kollel Iyun Hadaf</b>, was founded in Elul, 5756 (August, 1996) by Rabbi Mordecai Kornfeld in order to provide a free resource center for Dafyomi learners around the world.</p>

                  <p>Since 1923, through the initiative of <a href="../dafyomi.htm">Rabbi Meir Shapiro</a> and other world leaders of Jewry, Jews throughout the world have been united in the common study of the daily Daf of Gemara, covering the entire Talmud in a 7-year cycle. Tens of thousands of Dafyomi learners from dozens of countries are regularly receiving the Kollel's mailings through e-mail and the Internet. </p>
                  <p>
                  The Kollel's archives are in constant use by many who are not currently following the Dafyomi schedule as well. They have become an integral part of the curriculum of tens of schools around the world.</p>
